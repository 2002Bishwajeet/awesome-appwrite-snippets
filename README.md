### How to do it

Fork the repository and create a new branch.

```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo>

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
# Fix some code...

git commit -m "Fix typo in README.md"

git push origin <new-branch-name>

```

The commit naming follows [this structure](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

###To add new snippets

1. Create a new file in the `snippets` directory of the format `<name>.code-snippets`. If the name convention exists already, just add them in that file.
2. To add a new snippet, replace the following skeletion code.

```json

    "snippetName": {
        "scope" : "<lang>", // Add the language scope here. For e.g `dart`
        "prefix" : "<suitable-prefix-name>", // Add the prefix which tells vscode that this snippet is being called
        "body" : "<snippet-body>", // Add the snippet body here.
        "description": "<snippet-description>" // Add the snippet description here.
    }
```

Follow this [page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) to create snippet body.
